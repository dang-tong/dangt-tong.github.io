Hi! I’m Tong, an Associate Professor at the University of Science and Technology of China, in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences. I’m an .

My work and research
======
Currently I focus mostly on the modeling the space environment of planets. We have carries out a series of magnetosphere-ionosphere models of the Earth, Venus, Mars, and in the future Io. The model have the capability of capturing high-resolution structures such as Kelvin-Helmhotz instabitliy. We are also comparing observations such as "Tianwen-1" and other ongoing satellites to advance our understanding of the planetary physics.

Prospective students
======
Students with background from space physics, astronomy, physics, and computer science are welcome. I hope you have broad interest in planetary science and the spirit of self-learning and exloration. We can get together to do something exciting.
