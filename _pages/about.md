Hi! I’m Tong, a space and planetary physics scientist at the University of Science and Technology of China, in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences. I’m working on developing numerical models to simulate the "space weather" of planets, and applying the models to unveil the physics behind space phonomena from observations. The planet study also provide references for the scientific objectives of future planetary exploration missions, and serve the deep space exploration.

My work and research
======
Currently I focus mostly on the modeling the space environment of planets. We have carries out a series of magnetosphere-ionosphere models of the Earth, Venus, Mars, and in the future Jupiter and Saturn's satellites. Our models have the capability of capturing high-resolution structures such as Kelvin-Helmhotz instabitliy. We are also comparing observations such as "Tianwen-1" and other ongoing satellites to advance our understanding of the planetary physics.

Prospective students
======
Students from majors of space physics, astronomy, physics, atmospheric physics, and computer science are welcome. I hope you have solid background of physics, broad interest in planetary science and computer programming, and the spirit of self-motivation. We can get together to do something new and exciting.
